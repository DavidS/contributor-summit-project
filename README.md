# Contributor Summit 2019 Project Month

Contributor Summit project month is an experimental new format that builds on hack
sessions from past Contributor Summits and refocuses on long-term sustainability.
We're hoping that not only do you get a supported chance to play with some of our
new technology, but you can build it into something that contributes to the larger
DevOps community. We'll kick things off in May with a month-long collaborative
hackathon and make our first releases during Contributor Summit. If you're attending
then you can even take the stage for a few minutes to talk about your project if
you'd like.

We'll work with you via Office Hours throughout the month to help you maximine the
value of your time and reduce the amount of overhead you'll have to handle. See below
for some of the ways that Puppet can collaborate with you.

There are no real restrictions on what projects you can choose, only two suggestions:

1. You should be able to complete an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) release in one month.
1. The project should contribute something positive to the world of DevOps.

This means that your project could be anything from a Puppet module, to a CI or
testing framework, to enhanced documentation for another project, to a process or
pattern proposal. The possibilities are endless!

We're glad that you're joining us on this adventure. It will be fun!

# Getting Started
It's easy to get going and mostly self-directed. Just let us know what you're working
on and what we can do to help you out. When the Project Month opens, this page will be
updated with instructions on how to do that.

Much of our coordination and conversation will take place in the [Puppet Community Slack](http://slack.puppet.com).

We recommend that you keep your project in a GitHub (or other hosting service) repository.
We've put together [a few tips](PM.md) on project management in a GitHub repository.
If you'd like, you can also use this repository and the attached project board
[as a template](PM.md#using-this-repository-as-a-template), but you're certainly not required to.

If you need Git or GitHub help, you might start with these guides:

* [Getting Started on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* [...all GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)


# Collaboration Resources Provided
We would like to help ensure your success. We'll be working with you to help keep your
projects on track. We'll help you define your project scope and set roadmap goals, then
check in with you roughly weekly. (Milestones are scheduled for each Wednesday, but the
actual checkin date & time will vary.) In addition, during the project month we'll provide
several resources and services that you might not otherwise have access to.

Some of the resources will be provided via webinars or by downloaded materials and some
will be provided as short one-on-one chats or video consulations. The Puppet community
team will coordinate with each of you to ensure that you receive all the help you need.

See [the resources list](../../blob/master/RESOURCES.md) to see examples of what we could offer.


# Project Ideas
If you need a little inspiration to come up with a project idea, we've put together a 
[list of some suggestions](../../blob/master/PROJECTS.md). Feel free to use what you'd like from here,
no credit is needed.

If you'd like to collaborate with others for your project, please put a prominent note in
your project's `README.md` and socialize your idea in the `#contributor-summit` Slack
channel. And conversely, if you're looking to join a project, ask in channel. You might also
browse the [forks](../../network/members) and see if any look exciting.


# Questions?

* Can I work on an existing project?
   * Sure! It would help us keep track of projects if you forked this repository and
     add your charter and a link to the actual project repository as the `README.md`
* Can I work on something that's not software?
   * Absolutely. Use this month to write a DevOps book, if you'd like! Just define the scope
     of your project and any deliverables appropriately.
* How will we communicate during the project month?
   * Project coordinators may contact you via email or Slack.
   * We'll hold weekly [#office-hours](http://puppetcommunity.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=office-hours) on Slack.
   * We've also got a [#contributor-summit](http://puppetcommunity.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=contributor-summit) Slack channel for conversation any time.
   * Email community@puppet.com if you need anything.
* What if I have other questions?
   * Email community@puppet.com and we'll do our best to answer it!
