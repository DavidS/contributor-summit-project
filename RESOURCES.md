# Project Support Resources

Here is a sampling of some of the things that Puppet can offer to support you
through this project sprint. Some resources will be provided via webinars or by
downloaded materials and some will be provided as short one-on-one chats or
video consultations.

Obviously, not all of these resources make sense for everyone or all projects.
Identify if any of these resources would be helpful for you and let us know.
If there's something else that we can do, let us know that too.

You're in the driver's seat!


## Project management coaching
It can be hard to complete and ship a release on time if you don't have a vision
and roadmap in place. Defining that roadmap and sticking to it takes practice.

* Weekly progress check-ins
* Help scoping your project and roadmap for the initial release
* Scheduled office hours for when you need help getting unblocked
* Advice on predicting community demand for your project

## Documentation review
Writing a good quality README is hard. Especially if you don't quite know what
your users will need to help them understand how to use your tool. But having
good documentation is crucial to achieving audience adoption.

* Puppet module documentation tutorial
* High level documentation sanity check and advice

## Test design review
Designing good unit tests can be hard and mocking out the right things to ensure
valid tests can be even harder.

* Help designing your project's testing strategy
* Sanity check your test suite
* Advice on writing effective mocks or stubs
* Help determine testable requirements

## Technical review
Would a second pair of eyes on your code help? Do you need a sanity check on
some possibly questionable design decisions you'll be making?

* Sanity check project architecture
* Limited availability code review
* Bolt task/plan workshop and advice

## Designing for usability
It's easy to forget that people using our products aren't always experts in the
same things that we are. When building graphical or web applications it's hard
sometimes to predict the limitations that users might have.

* Webinar on user centric design
* Quick UX sanity checks
* Advice on running lightweight user studies

## Internationalization
Internationalization is one of those things that often gets postponed or ignored
because it's seen as being hard or tedious. We can help get you set up and it
just might be easier than you think!

* Webinar on internationalizing a Puppet module or software project
* Translation resources
* Sanity check of internationalization resources 

If there's something that would really help move your project along, feel free
to ask community@puppet.com or in Slack and we'll see if we can accomodate.
